Not sure what a comparable ICE to EV3 will be, since I have not seen an EV3, but yes, the MSRP for a Kia forte is 23k, so less than half. Assuming EV3 is closer to a Selto, the MSRP is 28k. A very far cry from 48k for EV3 even after the 5k government incentives, even after the 12.5k combined Quebec incentives, which is the highest in Canada, and is about to end. At least with the Quebec benefits, if you take 10 years of gas prices into consideration, maybe it will start to make a bit of sense to opt for EV. But the EV pricing is generally bunkers here.

Lets not forget oil changes. I did them every 8000km thats about 40 oil changes over 300,000km at 100 dollars each thats 4 grand. Transmission fluid changes every 100k where 500 dollars in just oil (ford trans fluid is expensive).

If you dont drive much it doesnt make sense but if you drive alot like me(30,000+km a year) then it makes total sense.

Price drop this year on LFP. Price war ongoing. Legacy auto took 2024 off.  

2025 USA will be selling all EVs with the same charging port. First time in history.

Tesla has confirmed Model 2 will be built in existing factories. Lead time to ramp up is late 2024. 6 months. Not 2 years to build a factory.  

Model 2 will eat into Model Y sales and more so Model 3.  

Tesla has 2 options. Start selling the Model 2 before GM and Volvo or after. 

Like most things it will come down to timing. New announcement in October. But Tesla will release the Model 2 when it makes sense and it's hard to make it make sense when GM and Ford have nothing.

But,but, you can't compare China prices with US/EU prices they have so many advantages...

OK. So take a look at S. Korea with its Casper for $13K, the Kia EV3 going for $22K.  Once again that's a cheap city car and an affordable entry level for very reasonable prices. Take a look at Mexico where autoworkers make less than their Chinese counterparts.

In addition, the industry is a huge consumer of goods and services from many other sectors and contributes to a net employment impact in the U.S. economy of nearly 8 million jobs. Approximately 4.5 percent of all U.S. jobs are supported by the strong presence of the auto industry in the U.S. economy.

It is $2.55 per gallon at Costco for me. So thats over 1,900 gallons. If the car gets 25 mpg, that average driver would be driving over 47,000 miles per year. If the car is a hybrid with 45 mpg, that is over 85,000 miles. 

Assuming 12,000 miles per year, with a hybrid that gets 45 mpg, that is $680 per year where I am. Gas is awfully cheaper right now, but likely it will be under $800 for this type of car in the near future. 

Granted, my electricity rates are half of what you state (and even less in the winter). So Im guessing it would only be $300-$400 per year in charging for an electrical car for 12,000 miles.

They have the same number of pedals, you can just drive without touching the brake.

All one-pedal drive does is change how far you press the accelerator before the car starts moving. No accelerator push = full brake. Some accelerator = no brake, coasting More accelerator = car starts moving.

I'm glad it's an option on most vehicles. Coasting is more energy efficient anyways. To coast in one pedal drive you have to press on the pedal, which to me, encourages energy inefficient driving.","2_1_1_3_1"

But every EV I've driven, which is only around 4, all have this feature off by default. A lot of them have it as as secondary drive mode you shift into. But yeah, it's like driving with a very aggressive engine brake on constantly. Some cars let you adjust how STRONG the engine brake is and I believe Rivian has an option for strength but no way to turn it completely off.","2_1_1_3_1_1_1"

It's really weird to experience and feels weird coming from a gas vehicle.

Another way to envision it. if full brakes is -10, coasting is 0 and full accel is 10. One-pedal drive mode means touching no pedals is around -5, pressing slighting on accelerator moves that from -5 until you're maybe a 1/4th or a 1/5th of the way into the accelerator then you're at 0. So to coast, you always have to be pressing the accelerator, otherwise you'll be braking. to accelerate, you just have to use more of the accelerator than you normally would.","2_1_1_3_1_1_1_1_1"

Outside of the intended speed/load combinations a motor will lose efficiency, simply won't work or even sustain damage. ICE engines are actually more sensitive in this regard and it's why they need so many gears.

It's relatively simple to design a motor for a specific speed and this is how most powerplant generators are designed, they always spin at a constant speed that is some multiple of the grid frequency. 

Wind turbines have to be more flexible in their operating conditions, but you still will sometimes see them completely still when the wind is too weak or too strong to run safely or efficiently.

Cars have to work well over a very wide range of conditions and are very sensitive to changes in efficiency due to the high weight and cost of batteries. Electric cars became feasible in part due to advancements in lithium batteries spurred on by the explosion of smartphones, but also due to complex motor designs that provide a high level of performance in a wide range of conditions.","2_2_1_2_1_1_2"

At very low speed the motor generates no back voltage (EMF). So if you were just to connect the power supply across the motor terminals it would conduct a massive current very briefly before burning out. Inverters specifically reduce the effective voltage applied to the motor at low speed. At high speed the back EMF of the spinning motor approaches the voltage of your supply, limiting the current you can produce in the coils. Your inverter can then generate out of phase currents to suppress part of the back EMF and allow the motor to operate at higher speeds than otherwise possible.","2_2_7"

Really though, all cars ""brake"" when you remove throttle to some degree, it's just that EVs tend to have a much steeper curve, and a lot of people end up driving them like automatics, where they fully pull their foot off the throttle to slow down, always triggering full regen, instead of simply backing off the throttle and easing into the regen region.","2_6_3"

They are much quieter, have a ton of torque and pep, very little maintenance is required, easier and quicker to charge than getting gas (I also loathe pumping gas- especially in the cold winter months), and Im not putting money into fossil fuel cartels and foreign nations. EVs have a much lower center of gravity so they feel much more stable to drive. Add that into additional energy cost savings (it costs &lt;1/3rd the cost of gasoline to charge where I live), less carbon footprint, and, IMHO, a much better overall driving experience.  We typically dont drive more than 250 miles in a day and when we do I can top it off at a charger in less than an hour (a great break to grab something to eat or hit up the restrooms).

Regen braking in most cars recoups 85-90% of the kinetic energy in the form of electric energy.  On the other hand, barreling down the expressway at high speeds causes exponential losses in efficiency due to air resistance (and those losses really add up).

It doesnt sound logical that a car would get more MPGe in stop and go, low speed traffic than going at high speeds over the same roads& except that the losses due to air resistance at those speeds is greater than the 10-15% loss of regen braking in stop and go traffic.  The exception to this would be if you were running your AC or heat in large amounts (those can be battery hogs).

All will trigger ABS of you brake with the brake pedal; some will (I think) trigger ABS in single pedal mode when you lift up, but at least one did not.


(I like to play around on snow days and poor traction situations, because I like to know exactly how things like stability control and ABS will behave before I'm ever in a situation where they come on unintentionally - so I've done a lot of provoking cars into skidding.)


I kind of hope they don't ""fix"" the no-ABS behaviour; I get the most control on snow when I can force the wheels to lock or not lock on command, and having the regen paddles as a hack for this is quite useful. I'm always annoyed when there isn't an easy fuse to pull to disable ABS :)","2_9_2"

It doesn't work when the battery has too much charge, or if it's too cold outside. You get a little indicator that displays whether regen breaking is 'degenerated'. It usually is.

So you still use one pedal for slowing down but actual stopping usually does involve the brake pedal.

Which is all fine, you kind of develop a feeling for it and naturally use the pedal when needed.","2_10"

Even if you come to a complete stop using one-pedal driving, you should still press the brake pedal while stopped.

If you get rear-ended without the brakes engaged, you're at a much higher risk of rolling forward. If this happens while you're stopped behind another car, you're more likely to hit the car in front of you, and your insurance will absolutely consider you to be at-fault for that, *especially* if you weren't actively braking at the time. If this happens while you're waiting at an intersection, you'll roll into the intersection and be at risk of getting t-boned by other traffic.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love one-pedal driving and normally drive exactly as you do - I very rarely have to touch my brake pedal in order to stop the car. But I always press down the brake while the car is stopped, because it's safer. And there's really no downside to just activating the brakes while you're already stopped - that doesn't wear them down in any meaningful way.","3_1_18"

I'll preface by saying I drive both manual and automatic so it's not just that I'm used to auto and don't want things to change. I'm also not a boomer. 

The situation where I found this annoying was when parking. At very low speeds the creep function can allow for gradual manoeuvring without having to keep pressing the accelerator pedal by a tiny fraction. The auto hold function is similarly annoying when parking as you have to push the accelerator to the point where this disengages, which can be more than you need. I frequently need to park in very tight spaces so maybe this is a key factor. 

It's kinda hard to describe and may have been the car I was in but it seemed like the accelerator didn't have enough incremental/gradual progression and even a small press would mean it moved quicker than needed. For example when reversing out of an enclosed driveway I want to be literally creeping so I don't reverse into anything coming from the side etc. 

Each to their own of course but at least having the option is better than one way or the other. But it should be user set rather than factory set.","8"

1. The throttle mapping on most AT cars is way too aggressive, probably to game fuel economy tests. So you press the accelerator pedal more and and more, and you get nothing...nothing...nothing...then BOOM

2. The accelerator return spring on most cars is too weak, so it's easy to overstep

In this case, mind, I am not calling ""auto hold"" an option to disable creep. It... doesn't. The implementation varies a bit, but most of them will start creeping whenever it's not specifically brought to a complete stop. Most cars I tried to my recollection would also turn off auto hold whenever you shut the car off and back on.

Some cars, meanwhile, do not have an idle creep immediately when you put them in gear after starting, but will not return to no idle creep once in motion.

I know the previous model years from Hyundai don't let you turn it off beyond Auto Hold, which resets to off between drives. The Ioniq 5 and 6 might've changed that. Kia might've also changed it in the EV6, but the e-Niro was literally just the Hyundai Ioniq hardware for gear selector, etc, so I'm like 85% sure it's no different.

But for a lot of these cars I haven't tested new models for 3-5 years.

This thread has taught me that a lot of EV drivers don't use their brakes at all, and depend almost entirely on engine braking through one-pedal driving, so they're not touching any pedals when the car is stopped. This is dangerous, because if you get rear-ended and the brake pads aren't engaged, you're just going to free-roll forward - maybe into the car stopping in front of you, maybe into the path of the traffic going the other way at at red light, maybe into the pedestrian crossing the street in front of you...","11_2"

The only time this isn't the case is in neutral, in which the transmission is disconnected from the transaxle.","17_1_1_1"

Edit: the original comment said automatic, but this goes for manual as well. Although on the automatic, when you use the brakes to stop, it engages the clutch automatically I believe.

I know a lot of people are used to it now, and think it is good for precise movement, but when clutchless automatic transmissions originally came onto the market, they were widely considered damgerous for this reason.  Pedal confusion is almost impossible in a manual transmission.  And in EVs, the digital throttle is so precise there is no reason to emulate this mechanic.","29"

It has varying degrees of deceleration and acceleration, all the way down to a one-pedal driving mode that has 0 idle at a stop. The varying degrees of deceleration control how aggressive the self-braking system is, because the car actually generates energy from braking and puts it back into the battery. For most heavily downhill drives, like coming back from snow boarding off the mountain, I'll actually end up with a little more battery at the bottom than what I had at the top. It's a very cool feature. This is how a lot of hybrids up to this point generated their electric charge, too. Most of the time, for city driving, I have it on one-pedal, no-idle mode because it generates the most charge (the trade off is that the acceleration isn't as responsive and zippy). But when I switch to my gas truck for long out-of-state hiking trips, I have to be careful and remember that it has an idle state. Almost cost me a couple of fender benders.

We're in Maryland and need to buy a used car for our son in the next month or two. He is a new driver and will primarily be the only passenger. We live in a single family home and would level 1 charge at home or install a charger. We'd like to spend $10k or less on a new driver car. But we want something reliable for him, and safe.

He will drive to school daily and he switches schools mid day... so about 30 miles daily

When he eventually drives to his other house some weekends it will add 40 miles that day, so 70 miles that day

We get very cold weather sometimes in Maryland, in case that reduces range. His daily drives will be a 30/70 mix of surface streets and highway driving. On the long days it will be generally highway driving.

I did some looking and this is what I've come up with so far:

||
||
|Model Details|Model Year|Safety Rating (NHTSA)|Expected Range (miles)|Expected Purchase Price ($)|
|2017 Ford Focus Electric - Higher range|2017|5|115|9985|
|2014 Ford Focus Electric - Older model with lower range|2014|5|76|8500|
|2014 Nissan LEAF SL - Popular and affordable, moderate range|2014|4|84|7495|
|2015-2016 Chevy Spark EV - Compact, nimble, city-focused|2015-2016|4|82|8500|

Boy. I hadn't added up the mileage before I made this post. It seems like all but the first option would be too limited on range. And maybe even the first, depending on how much range degrades over time.

We like the idea of EVs and hoped to not purchase another ICE. Not expecting any kind of investment here, just a purchase to cover a need, not looking at later resale value. What do you think? 

It this a situation that just a cash car ICE makes sense? 

Would spending a bit more solve the range issue? 

Any specific model suggestions?","3"

* Your going to want a 200+ mile EV for the winter. A Bolt, Kia Niro EV, Hyundai Kona EV could do the winter drive on a full battery no problem. I've driven 140miles in 17F in my Niro EV.

* I'm only nervous about the winter 70 miles drive if he can't fast charge. Getting a EV with a fast charging plug, preferably a CCS plug is better. CHAdeMO plug EVs would work, just a little scarce to find the CHAdeMO charger these days

https://youtu.be/4cVWy4yrB3E



* A Ford Focus with the CCS would be my next pick since it has the CCS plug to charge in case he needs to charge at a public fast charger to get home.

* VW e-Golf also has a CCS plug and is one of the older short range EVs.CCS is the more predominant fast charger plug for now until it gets replaced over the next 10 years.

* BMW i3 with REX or range extender engine may be ok. The gas engine didn't do much when I was reading up on people's experience 5 years ago.


* Kia Soul EV. Has CHAdeMo plug. 

* Mitsubishi i-MEV. 

* Mercedes B250. I know nothing about this one.

* Chevy Spark, can't remember if this has CCS.

* Fiat 500. Leaf is probably roomier.


* Leaf I would have some concerns. It doesn't have an active battery cooling/heating system. If you did do a /r/NissanLeaf, would recommend the bigger battery trim.

Not sure if dealers usually offer good terms if you stay with them, but it seems theyre going to try and push us into the Ioniq since thats all they have.

* Could you finance a used EV (like a Kona)? Go to your bank, ask about auto financing. They give you approval paperwork. You search for a car deal within that price range that you can finance. Make the deal, bank owns it while you make payments to the bank.


* Suggesting used since the prices are better, so your monthly payments will be less. Especially the Kona and Niro.

* Do you do much road tripping with your Kona? The Subaru Solterra should have some lower priced leases. The Toyota Bz4x should as well, but I felt the drive handling was much worst. 


* Edmunds website has a good car search feature and price gauge. That's a starting point to find affordable EVs and then contact the dealer directly for the specific vehicle.


* Chevy Equinox EV would be more equivalent and slightly better features and specs than the Kona. They're the lowest priced best specs EV on the market right now. 


* Maybe this weekend you might be able to find a Drive Electric Week to test drive other models and see if any local owners have tips on the market in your area.


* If you haven't leased under the current EV tax credit rules. Make sure the dealer can provide the IRS form upon the sale. You need to walk out of the dealer with the keys and the IRS paperwork. Otherwise you won't be able to do the tax credit when you file your taxes.","6_1"

2014 bmw i3, 2017 ford focus EV, and now their current and longest ownership a 2019 Nissan leaf 

Their theme is in-town commutes to Walgreens, Publix, CVS, home Depot, Costco and dinners out with friends and go to their houses 

They asked me if I can help them look for other EVs on the market and are currently looking at a Toyota BZ4x, which i have not nice things to say about... So I've compiled out some for them to look at like the new Chevy equinox EV, mustang Mach e, Hyundai ioniq 5 and 6, Kia Niro EV and even the Hyundai Kona EV and a 2024 f150 lightning flash for shits and giggles (I have a 2023 lariat lightning) , but what others could I add to their list of options?

Another Redditors review.


https://old.reddit.com/r/CadillacLyriq/comments/1fmf5yx/the_chargepoint_home_flex_is_soooooooo_much/

* Emporia. The cheapest option. More expensive have things like load management for multiple EVs or solar and scheduled charge time.

https://www.emporiaenergy.com/ev-chargers/


* Wallbox. Its small. WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. In case the wifi is out, it would still connect with Bluetooth.

* Enphase. Formerly ClipperCreek. ClipperCreeks have been known to be still charging for more than a decade on the outdoors public charging stations. Solar integrated system if you want that for the future. Pricier.

Either way, it should be a price reduction at the Point of Sale. So the technical detail doesn't matter.


Depending on the math, as I understand it, the tax credit can 1) reduce the sale price, or 2) raise the residual value. Either way, the difference between the sale price and residual rate is reduced. That's the depreciation of the vehicle that you're paying for in a lease. Depreciation ($) divided by the months (24 or 36) is your monthly payment.

Generally speaking, electric vehicles imply a larger upfront cost than a traditional vehicle, but will pay off over time as your consumables cost (electricity instead of fuel) can be anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 the cost.

The Prius Prime or RAV4 Prime (My wife and I have a regular hybrid RAV4 along with our Solterra and it's been trouble-free for 5 years so far) would definitely be reliable but you wouldn't be able to go your entire 60 mile commute without burning gas unless you can plug in at work.

I don't know much about the EV Volvos, some people like them though I've heard of them having occasional charging problems. Then again, EVs tend to break down less than comparable gas-powered vehicles so it may be OK? This is also a reason to reconsider US-built EVs, many of them (Especially Ford) are reported to be quite reliable as long as you don't buy the first year of any given model.

A final thought: Consider lightly used EVs about 1 year old with under 10k miles, they can often be had for $10-15k less than the same car would be when new, a good deal even if you can't get a tax credit.","15_1_1_1"

I just needed to clarify what you needed.

* Hyundai/Kia are leading the EV technology since they went straight for the 800v architecture battery pack for their e-GMP 2nd Gen EVs. Meaning they charge in the fastest time for the lowest car price. If they're off the table.

* The federal tax credit is to incentivize consumers to buy North American made EVs to bolster the American auto industry and clean up our air. Going away from the American brands will limit us on the tax credit eligible vehicles, but I can work with that. Only the Honda Prologue and VW iD4 would be eligible for the federal $7500 tax credit with a purchase. All the others would be on a lease or auto manufacturers giving a $7500 rebate.

https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/tax2023.shtml


* Used BMW i4 sedan or BMW iX crossover. Consistently the best range and exceeding it's EPA range in Edmunds and Car and Driver testing. BMW quality materials, drive handling and infotainment. I'm seeing them in the $30k+ range.



* Volvo XC40 and C40. One is more sloped than the other in the rear. Volvo is owned by Geely.  Very comfortable ride and the simplicity of Volvo's design language to make visually attractive and easy to use. Volvo is partnering with Starbucks to build ChargePoint stations. Standard 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Bev5QDPnQho


* Mercedes EQB. Very nice Mercedes interior and infotainment. Mercedes has an agreement with EVGo, Electrify America, and ChargePoint charging networks. Herz has a sale on EQBs right now. 


* Toyota BZ4X gets crossed off the list because it's a 200ish mile EV. Toyota has been putting off R&amp;Ding EV tech and focusing more on their hybrids. Not the greatest ride quality, felt really cheap and jerky.

* Subaru Solterra I liked more for the drive quality and handling. Twin to the Bz4x, but just felt better. The dash in that awkward spot actually works well. Range is much lower and the first year models have the worst charging speed. The charging speed got bumped up the 2024 year. Subaru and Toyota also cap fast charging after 2 charges per day last I heard. That way they ensure the battery doesn't get driven as much, maybe making the vehicle last longer.

* Nissan Ariya. Really comfortable ride. The adaptive cruise control was decent. Not an exciting pick, just well balanced. That right Rogue size look to it.

* Honda Prologue. Felt really good to drive, like a Honda. Native Google maps infotainment. Eligible for the tax credit. Pretty good space in the trunk.

* VW iD4. Not the fastest pick of the bunch. Solid EV, good history now. Infotainment is meh according to reviews. Looks chunky in the trunk. Tax credit eligible.

* Acura ZDX is eligible for the tax credit, so that might drive the price down with other discounts to below $50k.","15_2_1_1"

* VW iD Buzz, which is just coming out. The specs are pretty solid for a family vehicle. There is criticism of the range. I suspect families will tell us that kids will determine the stops, not the EV.

* Kia EV9. Highly rated and recommended. Kia's flagship EV. Very comfy. Infotainment and nav is ok. Surprisingly roomy inside. Has V2L and soon V2H. Owners in the hurricane areas are prooving that is a valuable feature to keep the family safe and comfort. Lot is deals right now.


* Hyundai Ioniq9 is probably a next year 3 row SUV. The sister to the EV9. Probably looks like the Sante Fe. Kia and Hyundai have put out 3 generations of EVs, so their experience of putting out solid EVs shows.

* Jeep is just putting out their first full EV with the Wagoneer S and Recon. The quality and issues are going to be a bit of an unknown. It's Stellantis's do or fold moment. 

* Rivian is very popular as a family vehicle and as an outdoor focused R1S SUV. Solid history. Great dealer model. Very good community. They look likely to survive. Their $5Bil deal with VW is going to keep Rivian going.



Moving away to 2 rows.


* Hummer EV SUV is an SUV. Not 3 rows, but very large, in charge and comfortable. GMC's moonshot flagship. Can confirm, test driving is comfortable and powerful. GM is doing a lot to support their EVS.

* Cadillac Lyriq and Chevy Blazer EV are probably more what you're looking for as similar size to the Atlas Cross Sport from what I can see.","16_3"

* EVs work really well in cold.  For a short commute to work, the range penalty from the cold doesn't matter. Don't need to wait 15 mins for it to heat up. Just remote start the heater or use the departure time to have the car preheat itself before she leaves.

Unfortunately Im a bit upside down on the Avalon which is why Im intrigued about the rebate. That and good mpg generally went hand in hand with zero power. EVs changed the game in that realm.
1. San Antonio, TX
2. Trying to be under $25k for the clean used vehicle rebate.
3. I like sedans but honestly am not picky, would go crossover/hatch/suv
4. Have test driven a 22 Bolt and a 21 Model 3 SR+. The Bolts interior was nicer than I expected, however performance was interesting to me. It took off well once I was moving but off the line it lagged almost like a boosted 4 cylinder and then spun the tires. The Model 3 felt nicer overall, rode a bit better and was a smidge quieter. 
5. Within the next month ideally.
6. 70 miles a day, 350 a week outside of random short trips. I take back roads as its half the traffic and nicer scenery vs the local highways. We generally take the wifes Sequoia on weekends/pulling the campers.
7. Single family home with garage.
8. Yes.
9. We have a 2 year old son and 2 month old daughter and two small dogs. 

Im open to most any options, however Im a bit more leery of the Korean twins. I will admit they have come a very long way though, not against a test drive but havent seen much in my price range. Also the Leafs Im leery of given the lack of thermal management.
Been watching Teslas used inventory. Having driven the Model 3 today Im definitely on the fence, getting familiar with the controls will be a learning curve for sure. It impressed me over the Bolt, but theyre just such a value right now. I could buy an earlier Bolt at a much shorter term and avoid being upside down in the future. 

Whenever I see the 0% rates plus the tax credits it gets my gears turning but I think going with a newer EV may be a better choice further down the line.
Thanks in advance and hope yall are having a great week so far!","19"

I dont drive much, but its fine. Compared to my manual mazda it doesnt drive as much and does not have as much pickup from a stop.  The 2024 kona had its acceleration nerfed so i never burn rubber with it, which i did with my mazda.  also the headrest and back cushion are absolutely awful for me, so i had ot add additional cushions.  

but i love the color, the tech amazes me (compared to 17 yo base model mazda!) and i'm thrilled to have an EV.  I drove it to my moms - I95 was a parking lot so it took 6 hours but much of that was stop-and-go - and i charged once each way for 15 minutes, and my back was fine.  

I've carried a lawnmower in it, but i dont think anyone has actually sat in the back seat yet?  My family refuses to drive it but whatever. This and my last car were the only cars we ever bought new, so i think that makes them nervous.

Hey everyone, Im looking for some advice on whether buying a **Tesla** is the right move for me given my current situation. Heres the relevant info:

\[1\] **Location**: I live in Souther California.

\[2\] **Budget**: Im looking at a monthly payment of **$616** if I go with the Tesla, which would only be a **$44/month difference** from what I currently pay for my Subaru.

\[3\] **Vehicle Preference**: Im interested in the **Tesla Model Y** due to the lower long-term maintenance costs and fuel savings.

\[4\] **Cars Im Considering**: I currently drive a **2023 Subaru** with **37,000 miles** and also own a **2022 Nissan**, which I dont plan to trade in. Im considering selling the Subaru for around **$26,000** and using **$3,500 from the sale** along with **$2,000 in Tesla discounts** and a **$7,500 federal rebate** to reduce the Tesla cost.

\[5\] **Estimated Purchase Timeframe**: Im looking to make this purchase within the next **month** if it makes financial sense.

\[6\] **Commute**: I drive about **25,000 miles a year**, with a commute of **42-50 miles one way**, depending on the route. I currently spend around **$250-$350/month on fuel**.

\[7\] **Living Situation**: I live in an apartment but have access to a **110v charger** at home, where I would pay **$0.41 per kWh** for electricity. Theres also a **supercharger** across the street.

\[8\] **Home Charging**: I dont plan on installing additional charging as I have access to charging at home and the supercharger nearby.

\[9\] **Other Needs**: No major cargo or passenger needs  no kids, but I do have a pet.

Im mostly concerned about whether switching to the Tesla makes sense given my heavy commute and the fact that the Tesla would reset my loan and add **$15,000** to our family debt. Im worried that **long-term maintenance costs** for the Subaru could end up being more expensive than if I went with the Tesla.

Any thoughts on whether this is a **smart financial move** or if I should stick with my current setup? Thanks in advance for your advice! This is a subreddit devoted to Team Losi Racing R/C vehicles.

* In California, the electricity prices are jacked up from PG&amp;E. It's actually cheaper to charge at fast chargers than it is to charge off an outlet. In your situation. Check out PlugShare, filter for NACS plug and poke around at the orange charging locations by your place. You'd probably want to charge at the $0.29-$0.49/kWh stations. 


* Cost over time, calculate your savings owning an EV compared to gas. See what layout makes sense to you. I personally used the energy.gov and fueleconomy.gov to make my decision.

* Since you're charging off fast chargers. You might consider other EVs that come with free charging credit for the first two years. Mercedes EQB Hyundai Ioniq5 both have 2 years of free, 30 min charging. 

* EVs do have cost savings if the electricity is cheaper than gas. And certainly long term savings of low mantinance. I've only needed to rotate tires, replace window wipers, buy new tires.

Hello. 
I am considering buying a Citroen e C4 which is considerably cheaper (14000 EUR) than other cars of the same model because its driven kilometres is 211000. (131100 miles) 

Is it a good idea to buy an electric vehicle with many kilometers driven? The car was produced in 2022 and seems in good condition.

And do you have any other important advice for buying a used EV.

The options in the US basically seem to be a used Chevy Bolt (\~$18k for a 2022 with 27k miles is what I see, we're not eligible for any tax credits on it) or a new Nissan Leaf SV or Plus (\~$32k for a new Plus after credits).

If the price were right, I'd _definitely_ go with it over the Bolt or Leaf; the only bad thing about it IMO is that there have been some fairly significant software bugs at launch, but I'd think by the time you can get it (assuming you're in the USA and waiting for tax credit-eligible models to arrive) that should be ironed out.

I'm not sure if Nissan has since fixed this, but an early 2nd-gen Leaf I test drove did not have a telescoping steering wheel, you could only move it up and down and not closer/farther away from you. This made the seating position extremely uncomfortable for me.

As the other commenter said, the lack of CCS and battery thermal management are major issues with the Leaf. CHAdeMO chargers are increasingly being removed with CCS having been the standard for many years now and the move to NACS means that many dual-connector charging stations will be moving from CCS+CHAdeMO to CCS+NACS. There is simply no future for CHAdeMO in North America and the miserable state of charging station reliability means the current installed base of CHAdeMO DCFCs will very rapidly dwindle as units fail and are replaced with CCS+NACS. The lack of thermal management is a significant downside to long-term ownership of a Leaf (e.g. 8, 10, 12 years) depending on specifics of your use case; a 2022 Bolt EV with 27k miles would probably be a better long-term ownership experience IMO, but nobody has a crystal ball to say that with certainty.

Personally, having driven both vehicles, I significantly preferred the driving experience and gauge cluster, infotainment, etc. in the Bolt. But honestly, I don't think there's a _colossal_ difference between the two vehicles; that being said, +$14K for the Leaf seems like a lot over a 2022 Bolt with 27k miles. Yes, there are some advantages to a new car, but I'd still be leaning towards the Bolt myself.","23_1"

The issue there is replacing a battery out of warranty is more expensive in many cases than just trashing the car and buying a different vehicle.

EVs also have some changes to charging port and capacity coming, so youll need an adapter in many cases. 

New EVs get more substantial subsidies (tax breaks) than used ones do. Elon is also making Model 3s so cheap new that it often makes more sense to buy new over used.

While I wont argue that weve hit peak EV or anything, it does seem automakers are betting *huge* on most people switching to EVs, but because you basically *must* have at home charging to make it worthwhile, a lot of people cant really justify the hassle.

Range anxiety is real and exacerbated the older an EV gets, although more infrastructure will help here.

Taken together, these things hurt EV resale value. The biggest one is battery repair cost, and I also didnt mention every individual factor.","1"

That should help people, but it really requires a home charger to make the battery satisfied, which will reduce the adoption rate.

I was able to achieve this price by buying during the rapid price reduction that occured during December, my state incentive is $2,250, and the federal incentive is $7,500 (only works if you took delivery in 2023). The RWD is the only model (to my knowledge) that offers the LiFePo4 battery chemistry. There is a chance the Model Y RWD only variant has the LiFePo4 battery. The downside is the charging (while fast), is not as fast as a Lithium Ion battery, but the rated cycles are much higher (2000 charging instances before real degradation). An added benefit of this battery chemistry is it is farrrrr less likely to have a severe fire incident like the Lithium Ion battery packs you see in your phones, tools and cars.","1_2_1_1_1_1_1_2_1"

That being said, battery replacement is a huge cost. So purchasing a used ev, has the other people used up the car and the batteries are nearing the end of the life span? So now you will get a year out of the vehicle and have to do a battery replacement? Cost of ownership is going to be outrageous then. Even though over the total life span of the car it's maintenance has been cheap. Now you get hit with the bill after purchase. Vs the used cost of a car plus a battery replacement, now you are in the territory of a new ev with tax rebates. Soooo used evs are in this strange area that it makes more sense to buy new than used, much like during covid if you could find a new car at msrp it was cheaper than a 3 year old one with 50k miles on it due to cheap financing of newer cars. And cost of ownership of a new vehicle vs 3 years old.","1_16"

I think it's a lot harder to build one than they realize. Teslas are common but they continue to have problems. And chargers are not everywhere. I live in a somewhat rural county; we have 2 superchargers in the county. And 1 of the 2 is an hour away from me, so not super convenient. 

Home charging is problematic for a lot of people who don't own homes. Where do you put your charger in an apartment building? I live in a condo and even here we could not put 30 charging stations (one for each unit) in our garage, we simply don't have the power to the building to support that. 

On the plus side, Tesla (and others) is looking at ""refurbing"" batteries. As I understand it, usually a battery fails because a subcomponent of the battery pack fails. I have heard they can replace the failed components and get some additional use out of the battery, though the range is reduced.","1_22"

The whole battery degradation thing is a myth. Batteries today are a lot better than when the original leaf debuted. Yes, I had one of those. Lost 20 miles from the 90 in the winter and was still able to get my kids to school and do everything I would normally. Never once having to call the tow truck. 

Theres a lot of misinformation out there. Yesterday got back from a 450 mile trip to Florida - no problem. Stopping once for 25 mins to hit the bathroom and get snacks. Car was ready to go before I was. Been all the way to Baltimore, Virginia, all over. Only using superchargers for road trips. The tax breaks have hurt the used market - no doubt. Hopefully itll be around when this one needs to be replaced.

There are teslas on the road with upwards of 200k on original battery. The warranty is up to 150 miles, where most gas cars would be ready for the crusher. Ive had the Prius, leaf, volt, Tesla, in that order. Will never go back to a fully gas car.","1_29"

I know they loose charge over time. I know theyre expensive to replace, but the odds are very low youll ever need to replace the battery. Just like the odds of you having to replace an ICE engine are low.

Most never will have an ICE engine rebuild because even thats an huge expense of $3-5K and its just worth it to scrap the car and buy a new car after the engine goes out. 

The point is you dont replace the EV battery just because it looses range. Most level off after 5 years in their loss and thus its not a constant loss over a longer period of time.

Most EV owners keep their car even at the lower range. So to scare folks away from EVs because of the high cost of a slim to nill battery replacement is pointless. Its like saying, well your ice car will need a $3-5K engine rebuild at year ten or 100K miles so dont buy it. Majority wont own a car 10+ years and majority who do will scrap their car when the engine fails.

Besides a battery is about $2500-5000 as well so theyre not far off in cost compared to an ICE engine. Even more battery replacement outside of their 8 year 100K warranty is very rare. And EVs have been around since 2008ish with Tesla roadster.","1_33_1_1"

I buy 3000+ cars a year at various auctions and through dealer to dealer sales. I say all that to reenforce that I work with and buy from car dealers very often. 

Used EV sales require a customer who wants one and is willing to do the work. Most dealers sell sell what they know, suggest what they like, and are comfortable buying (to resell) what has sold well for them in the recent past. For the most part, that is not a used EV. 

Lack of knowledge or willingness to commit their capital and take a space away in their inventory for a vehicle they understand better, have sales data for, and confidence that it wont sit on the lot and age is a real issue. Contrary to the general consensus, margins per car are not huge and it doesnt take much age (and price reductions) to create a losing scenario. A few losers poisons whatever willingness there once was to take a flyer and buy that used EV at auction or step up and get that one on trade. 

More on margins& a car deal has 2 sides, front end profit (own it for $X& sell for more than $X) and back end, finance revenue share, GAP, warranty, wheel and tire, basically all the shit they try real hard to sell you in the F&amp;I office. There is A LOT more opportunity for profit in the back end, and selling back end products on a used EV is not the same as a traditional ICE vehicle. They just arent available from as many vendors or the coverage is not compelling for the customer to see the value. For my current group, if we cannot offer our back end products the GMs dont want the vehicles. That means there are multiple ICE cars we do not source period, we have age and mileage restrictions, and yes& only a couple of EVs even make the eligible list currently. When Tesla cut prices last year (to qualify for the federal tax credit for new buyers) they tanked a lot of Model 3s and Ys that were in the used market. Absolutely destroyed their value. Luckily we were not holding a bunch of them but again& it only takes getting smoked on a couple to leave a lasting impression. 

Additionally EVs cause issues when purchased from auctions because the fucking charging cables just disappear& probably on Ebay or whatever. Replacements are very expensive and frequently backordered or delayed. Then we have to charge them at the recon facilities and at the stores. Everything about them is different and they cause headaches& GMs hate headaches, so getting used EVs in inventories is a fight. 

I am paid to show up and provide profitable inventory that meets the needs of the stores I buy for&period. If my cars age, meeting. If my cars are less profitable, meeting. If my cars require more recon, or unexpected recon, meeting. If GMs start noticing my name associated with problem cars or losers on their lots, meeting. Too many meetings, get a box and leave your keys and prox card on the way out. 

Until there is a market for used EVs that allows them to produce comparable (consistent) sales results, GMs arent asking for them and I am not forcing the issue.

All that said, if I can manage a deal on an F150 lightning I am a buyer. I live close to my office and have other vehicles for trips or whatever. I like having a truck and think that would be cooler than a Maverick. I have several Ford stores in my group and am watching& just need that value to drop a little more or for some dealer to get desperate and want out of one cheap enough and I will grab it.","2"

The reality is that cars dont just show up on lots and until the people in charge of deciding what does choose EVs, they will only be available on a limited basis. 

That makes sense, EV sales are like 5-6% of total sales and most of their growth is in the new arena where they are subsidized by tax credits and on dealer lots by force (MFR decides what cars are on new lots via allotment and quid pro quo agreements).

We will send it to a sister store for recon and resale, keep at the original store for recon and resale, trade with a non-affiliated dealer we work with, or send it to auction. When GMs dont like the risk they send it to auction, even if its super nice and clean. There are hundreds of thousands of very nice and super clean cars running at auctions every year. The stigma that an auction car means it needs work is not always true at all& they have those too, but they have everything else. 

The issue is the value. Retail comp sales are not easy to pin down on many models because the data is slim compared to ICE cars, and auction sales tend to swing much more than ICE cars because the sellers have very different sales motivations. When numbers are all over the place and your top down sentiment is to be cautious you choose the lower numbers to generate your bid and dont get as many trades.","2_1_1_1_1"

1) technology is still evolving rapidly. If I buy one today, I get a 250-mile range, but in a year or two 350-400-mile range, with Toyota claiming they have a 700-mile range in the next few years with their solid-state batteries. I know I am going to be extremely envious of those who have the new models and have the inferior range of that point of my earlier purchase, I won't get much when I go to sell my car used. This is known as the Osborn effect. 

2) used out of warranty is still a major gamble that the battery will go bad and the cost of replacement exceeds the value of the car.

3) I'm hesitant about installing a level 2 charger in my garage (I own a house with a garage I park my cars in) because the breaker box is at the opposite end of the house. I probably should get some quotes but I fear I'm looking at 2-3\_k to install the charger 

4) The combined income of my wife and I is too high to qualify for the 7k tax incentive and my state doesn't offer any incentive. 

5) in the rest of the developed world, consumers can buy cheaper Chinese EV's and those Chinese manufacturers are getting ready to produce cars in Mexico they could easily import to the US (avoiding tariff given nafa2.0). More competition will drive down prices (especially used prices) when more EV's at lower prices points become available; even if I wouldn't consider buying a Chinese ev (which I probably would if it reviewed well and the price was exceptional)

6) I have looked for used Ford mach-E's and they are still asking for greater than $40k for a few year-old models with under 40k miles for anything with extended range (270 miles per charge). I want to be under $30k. The Chevy Bolt EUV is too small for my family and my woodworking hobby; chevy and all other car mkers other EV's are barely out for sale, priced too highn and out of my budget. Would not consider Hyundi and kia given how they are failing to address the car theft issues for older cars without immobilizers. 

I know most will not read this. I mostly wrote this for myself so I can justify why I'm probably going to get a hybrid or phev.","3"

The tax credit thing confuses the hell out of people.  Ive been paying attention and still dont know for sure which brands/models get what and how much.  Also its supposed to be easier to claim starting 2024 - you can simply pass the credit to the dealer and take the up to $7500 discount at the time of purchase. So some might prefer to do that instead of dealing with a more complicated tax situation in 2023.
Most of the current EVs are expensive compared to their gas counterparts, and they are aimed at early adopters. Then you see Tesla dropping their prices left and right and it makes you hesitate and not be the sucker who buys something right before prices are cut.  More cheaper EV are coming into the market and people might also be waiting for those.","3_2"

Range anxiety, especially in cold weather.

Lack of charging infrastructure for apartment dwellers and street parkers. (too expensive for non-dwelling charging to save $)

Used market slow because people are realizing a new battery is $20k or more. Replacement battery would never pay for gas savings.

Electricity prices are soaring with green mandates. Up 24% in last 3 years alone. In some areas EVs are already more costly to run than gas. 

Very limited choices for less than $40 to 50k

Maintenance and repair: choice is very limited and repair costs are high because of the way they are manufactured. Here's a link to a story about a $42,000 fender bender. And see $20k battery.

In general, battery warranty is more than 8 years.

**In general, battery capacity decreases 5% in the first 50k miles, and loss decelerates subsequently.**

Predictive modeling by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory indicates that todays batteries may last 12 to 15 years in moderate climates (8 to 12 years in extreme climates).

With EV's, you can assess the battery condition via the interface.  You can see the number of charges, the current capacity, ...  It is interesting the information available versus ICE's.

Affordable EV's are are also disposable cars. Once the battery is half dead they are worthless. Many wealthy people who wanted EV's have already bought one, that high end market is saturated.

Working class market are the one buying ""affordable"" EVs now and they do not like the idea of having a car that is worthless after the battery is partially dead. They also don't like the idea of having to have a separate car to travel long distances. And they don't like the idea of sky high bills to make repairs.

Meaning they are still selling more EVs year over year but the rate of that increase has slowed more than predicted. EVs arent going anywhere and they are a great second car for most people and a great primary car for some. The luxury EV market is bit flooded at the moment but cars like the Chevy Bolt and lower trim Teslas are still selling like hot cakes. The used EV market is strained because places like CO customers are getting $12,500 in tax credits and new car financing so it doesnt make sense to buy used.","12_1"

I feel strongly that if batteries were standardized such that third parties could produce them, people would be more exited about buying ev. I'd rather by my battery from Duracell, or an energizer instead of having to buy propriety ford, GM, BMW battery and have to pay what ever price they want to charge and as the battery technology advanced, I would be able to upgrade my car with greater range when my battery did die out  by just swapping the battery

The current models available are largely driven by greed and fear that if batteries were easy/affordable to replace, then cars would last too long. Designed obsolescence. 

Ford, GM, Tesla thought they could make a lot money making cars that lost 100% of their value at 100k miles. Kind of works for telsa because they're cool like apply phones; but not for the more expensive boring ford, GM models (their like android phones, no one thinks they are cool).  Toyota/honda proved that people want cars that last 300+k miles. I don't know why Ford and GM fail to realize this and keep making throwaway cars.","18_2"

The range is always significantly less than claimed .
Sometimes less than half of whats claimed .

Got a friend with the new F-150 golf cart and he gets 100 miles and has to start hunting for a charger . 
He paid a LOT of money for this vehicle .
Meanwhile , my 2005 expedition goes 350 miles on a tank and takes less than 5 minutes to refuel and I never have to be concerned about finding a gas station that has a dispenser that actually works ,and isnt occupied for an hour . 

The govts of blue states can ban the sale of gasoline cars , but they cant make people buy golf carts with 120 mile range .

My wifes car gets 35 mpg .
Has a range of 340 miles 
We paid $7k for it 
     
Im not opposed  to driving an electric car , but I aint paying $50k for a car with a 120 miles range , and then driving all over the place  to find a charger that isnt working or is occupied , when I can pay $7k for an nice used car that has a 340 mile range and takes eleven minutes to refuel at one of hundreds or gas stations along the route .

And thats not even getting into how the mineral mining for the batteries  is done by child  slave labor and how they destroy the environment with pollution around the mines and refineries, 

And how there simply isnt enough electricity to charge the electric cars anyway .
And how they are just coal powered cars . Etc etc 

Electric cars are just rich people virtue signaling .

Im richer than you .
Im better than you . This is a subreddit devoted to Team Losi Racing R/C vehicles. Buggies, Truggies, Short Course, electric, nitro, whatever you race, tune, mod,  feel free to share here.","24"

All of the folks that have fears about battery performance are the same people NOT buying evs and thus reducing demand. As a result they sell like crap.

Modern ev battery degradation is trivial, and the batteries will easily last the life of the car. What is a thing is absolutely horrible fast charging infrastructure if you don't have a Tesla which means:

1) you need to charge at home either with a high voltage outlet or an installed charger

2) road trips require planning, effort and more time bc of the lacking high speed infrastructure.

So you have both valid concerns and misconceptions about evs that reduce demand and kill the market for the time being.","35"

An EV necessarily requires you have some interaction with the car.  Things like configuring charging settings, pre-heating batteries for fast charging, mapping to chargers, etc.

Other than Tesla, none of them pass the 'grandma test' at all.

My son just bought a VW ID.4 and the infotainment is GARRRRRRRRRBAGE.  You can't map to chargers properly (seriously it doesn't even work when you click on them) and the infotainment looks identical to what I had in a 2010 car.

The interface to manage charging is awful and they charge $200 PER YEAR to just use the app (to do basic EV-positive things like tracking the charging while you're inside).

They never bothered to implement battery pre-heating in 3 years of the car being out, despite saying they wanted to, and this heating is ESSENTIAL to fast charging the car, so when you go to charge in winter, it starts at about a quarter the proper speed. 

The charging situation on CCS chargers is pretty awful, as well, his last visit to an Electrify America charger took 15 tries to get it started (moving to a different parking spot halfway to skip the broken charger with no indication it was broken).

My Tesla is a joy to own, frankly and I'd buy another like it in a heartbeat.  Unfortunately, Tesla replaced the nice leather with plastic and got rid of important controls like turn signals in favor of capacitive buttons, so even a new one isn't quite like my 2017.

But still, I think EV drivetrains are the future.","49"

Besides EV's being a luxury item in its nature and the way it is sold, there are some basic issues:

electricity prices are the highest they have ever been.

gasoline prices are not high at all

EV batteries kill  people when they explode

most cars don't explode, ever, if they have a wreck

EV batteries become defunct after wrecks.

batteries are expensive for EV

batteries are not a problem on a gasoline engine car

there is a limited track record for EV cars

There is long track record in performance and low cost for existing gasoline car lines

EV car fill up takes a long time.

EV car fill up at home requires electrical work...that costs a lot and the car was already expensive

When you drive your car to mexico, or some remote locatoin how do you fill up?

Other issues with EVs:

How do you bring extra fuel with you when you go off rode?

How do load your truck up with lumber or other heavy items when EV's are small cars?

First off, the (largely upper income) early adopter market is basically tapped out. These were people who were buying the car **because** its an EV. To expand sales will require selling to people for whom their new car *being an EV* is not a compelling feature. Current EVs are not there yet. 

Cost is a big factor. Most EV models are selling above the nearly $50K average transaction price for a new car. These prices are significantly less affordable (and sustainable) at the 9% loan rates currently available, compared to the 2% rates that prevailed a couple years ago. In fairness, its not just EVs; everything expensive is piling up on dealer lots. Go to your local Chevy or Ford store. Theyre drowning in loaded-to-the-gills full size trucks. 

Meanwhile, EVs are still selling for a significant premium over ICE vehicles of comparable size and equipment. For anyone whos not 100%, damn the torpedos committed to buying an EV, the typically $10k price premium is off-putting. 

The Inflation Reduction Act EV tax credit is a mixed bag here. Starting in 2024, the credit is restructured such that it can be claimed at time of purchase, so it directly lowers the out the door cost of the car. In the other hand. But while Uncle Sam gives, it also takes away. The credit was already restructured such that the full credit can only be claimed if the vehicle and battery were both assembled in a free trade (i.e. NAFTA) country, and such that caps on the vehicle selling price, and buyer income, are in effect. In 2024, the further restriction is being added, that raw materials for the battery cannot have been sourced from a FEOC (Foreign Entity Of Concern). Most cheaper EVs (including all standard range Tesla Model 3 and Y) have battery components or materials sourced from the PRC, and are thus completely ineligible for the credit. 

Then you get into charging infrastructure and time requirements, and range anxiety, both justified and imagined, which is a whole other can of worms. 

TL;DR: The early adopter market is tapped out. EVs sales expansion is now predicated on selling to buyers for whom the car being an EV is not a compelling feature. For these buyers, the hurdles with respect to cost, range and charging are proving to be significant hurdles.","79"

Couple that with the reduced range compared to ICE cars, the time it can take to charge an EV, and the fact that if the power goes out, you're up a creek, and a lot of people just aren't interested in switching over.

Some areas dump the coal waste in flood plains above water treatment plants. 

When hell froze over in Texas one winter and folks lost power or it got super expensive, how do you charge a car in a power outage?  Ditto either summer when you get hit with a rolling brown out.

On top of that, enough research is out and people really educated on the matter aren't having it.
     Our electricity infrastructure is outdated and shit, until this is addressed why are we talking about anything else. Majority of charging stations are diesel powered, double cost of vehicle to repair when battery issue occurs (and it will), proprietary tech and ev companirs being dicks about 3rd party &amp; diy repair, shit mileage in the cold. 
     At minimum current tech is definitely not the answer, but ev's as a whole are probably not the answer. Fuel powered engines can be made much much more efficient than they currently are. Id bet my life EVERY manufacture already has the know how &amp; capability to make 100mpg gasoline motors.

Ev's only makes sense for the very wealthy who have multiple of them, have fast chargers at home and no longer want to have to mingle with the povs. Oh and one Ford lightning could have made 90 hybrids.

I had an option to buy EV but I opted for a gas car instead because I live in an apartment style building and have no ability to charge it. I would imagine all the people living in apartments in US are in the same boat. Here in Los Angeles they are also hellbent in converting more single house units into multi-family, which is a trend that will continue for the foreseeable future. I also don't like that I have to wait much longer than it takes to refuel, since the fast chargers are not easily found (and even then it still takes longer than refueling a gas car). Range is also an issue. I wouldn't feel comfortable in taking the family on a long trip, as opposed to doing the same in a gas car, where you can find a gas station at every corner. Additionally, most mechanics can work on gas cars, while for EVs you need a specialized mechanic. Replacement parts and labor are more expensive as well. Replacing a failing battery can be as expensive as the value of the car itself (after a few years of use with depreciation and all). This also makes it harder to sell because the buyer doesn't know when the battery will fail.","141"

If you're someone who drives 200+ miles at a time (3 to 4 hours a day), an EV doesn't make as much sense and Range Anxiety becomes real.

Driving an EV on a long road trip is doable, but charge times are still in the 'slightly annoying' range where after 3 or 4 hours you want to stop for 45 minutes to an hour to go to the restroom, stretch and maybe grab a bite to eat or a coffee.  With current charge times, you're closer to about an hour to hour and 20 minutes for a comfortable charge time.

If you're a commuter driver where you're driving &lt; 100 miles each way per day, EV's are really great value even with battery degradation and cold weather.

IMO, EV's make a lot of sense in multi-car households where you have an ICE/Hybrid for long trips and a EV for commuting/shorter more regular trips.","160"

1. Interest rates combined with dealers still trying to get AMV, plus a bunch of bullshit add ons.

2. Longevity of EVs. While the first and maybe second owner will have low upkeep, when a battery starts to degrade (they all do), the cost to replace becomes astronomical. 

3. Cost. All vehicles right now, new and used, are expensive. EVs are no different, and combined with unknown longevity, makes it hard to justify the cost. 

4. Range. Gas stations are at damn near every corner. Charging stations are not. If you have to travel more than lets say 250 miles, you have to plan your whole trip off location of charging stations.","191"

A majority of people who buy used do so cause they want a better deal than buying new, with an EV that's usually not the case since repairs are insanely expensive as they haven't developed cheaper ways of making the parts like many hybrids have.

If you buy a used hybrid and need to replace the battery, it's usually anywhere in the $3-5k range, but since EV's have larger batteries that are harder to access, it can be anywhere from $10-20k to replace and are often more expensive than it would be to just trade in the car for a new one, and you know it's bad when you can get a better deal on trade-in than you do selling it yourself.

You also don't get the tax credit when buying used which has been the main incentive to go with an EV, with the price difference between charging and buying gas for a hybrid, it would take most people nearly 10 years to recoupe the difference in price between buying an EV and a hybrid even if there are no repairs at all which is highly unrealistic.

People have also caught onto the lies that manufacturers told when EV's came out like ""you hardly have to do any maintenance"" and ""things will rarely break cause there's less moving parts"", the people who ignored basic maintenance cause they thought EV's don't need them are now stuck trying to sell a half broken car or are trading them into a dealer who has to spend thousands fixing them and hoping for a sale or just offloading them somewhere else. There are many EV's that are basically just e-waste at this point even though there are gas cars 50 years older still running strong, EV's just don't seem to last as long.","198"

Even the steam powered coaches were preferred over electric for the same reasons ICE cars are preferred to electric vehicles now.

1) Cost

2) Range / Charging time

3) Infrastructure limitations (Only specific groups of people can deal with the lack of infrastructure supporting electric vehicles. We don't produce enough electricity to support charging so many vehicles on top of it all. California for example had to put restrictions on plug in EV charging because their power grid can't handle it. I wouldn't be surprised if that became common in other places soon like Arizona, where keeping the air conditioner running for people is more important than letting people charge their vehicles.

On top of that there has been a concerted effort by the electric producers to prevent people from generating their own power in some of the best areas for that, so people are still stuck paying crazy grid power prices to charge anyway.)

4) Aging/consumerism (Electronic systems age like milk compared to mechanical systems, not to mention the planned obsolescence inherent in creating vehicles more like consumer electronics.)

The only reason EVs are still in business at this point is because the government is trying so hard to force them down everybody's throats. EV companies as we know them now wouldn't even be a thing, nor would the traditional car companies be so gung-ho over producing shitty EVs if it were not for the billions upon billions of government subsidies that everyone is trying to get a piece of.

The price of replacement batteries is sky high, and some manufacturers don't stand behind their warranty. That leaves the customer with a huge bill.

1a. Used EVs prices are low because of the fear of the replacement costs of the battery.

2. There are limited repair options, as the OEM is in many cases the only source for parts and labor. Repair delays and sky high parts and labor. Tesla also doesn't have enough repair resources with the amount of cars they're selling.

3. Related to #2,  insurance rates are much higher. Just ask Hertz about that.

4. Range is often not as advertised.

5. Non- Tesla charging is lackluster.

6. As we saw with the Vinfast and Blazer EV, software is not ready for prime time.

7. Right to repair issues are questionable on these cars. Will you be able to repair your own car? Are parts and documentation readily available? More like a cell phone or laptop than a car.","215"

Cars should be a depreciating asset&

EV cars may appear more depreciated because most EVs sold so far are either Teslas - which has reduced prices for the used cars as well..

And non-teslas - most of which came in the market last year at the all time high price tag given the lack of supply, market hadnt recovered from the COVID supply issues, EV hype and the raised Tesla prices driving non-Tesla EV prices higher too.

Also, take note that the most buyers selling EVs now have likely used the $7500 incentive so the depreciation may appear more than it actually is given how much the buyers paid for it.","228"

It's a gasoline world. Simple.

The EV market trashes all that. I see people hanging out at two charging stations in this area. That's not something I'd ever want to do.

I would have to get a home charger installed. That's over $1000. But is my 150-amp service adequate for that? Not sure.

Do I want to junk the EV just because the batteries have deteriorated? My wife's 2004 car lasted until 2022. No EV would last that long.

It also takes hours to charge vs. filling up in minutes. Yes, yes, I know you usually charge when you get home and its on charge for 12 hours& but what about road trips? I dont want to have to make a 8 hour trip into 16 because I have to find a charge station and then charge up every 250 miles for a couple hours.

Additionally, (Im going to sound like a broken record here) our grid is not setup for everyone to have EVs charging at the same time. California already has power issues, how the hell do they expect everyone transitioning to EVs to go? Compromises will have to be made, and we all know everyone loves their AC in the summer

EVs are planned obsolescence.  They require FAR LESS tooling, engineering, and manual labor, so while the batteries are more expensive, the overall profit margin is higher. Sure, early Teslas are hitting very benchmarks, but as time goes by, existing manufacturers will engineer the batteries to have an expected lifespan to keep you coming back.  My prediction is 10 years.  While up north rust claims vehicles sooner, in the south it's not uncommon to have a 15+ year old vehicle.","247"

The sellers of used EVs haven't yet caught up to that pricing reality. Many of them are trying to sell at $10k below the new price.","265"

Going cross country is where things get tense. For instance in my area the nearest charging station is 45 miles in any direction. Plus the charge time for non-turbo chargers is pretty long.

Now that cold weather is on us, the battery efficiency is naturally lower and then you need to factor in the additional draw of  lights/wipers/cabin heat/ window defrosting.

Oh, don't forget that in really cold weather you need to pre-heat the battery before starting the charge cycle.

Out here gas and go is much more advantageous.","266"

However, I currently drive a Miata and I just did 80 miles on the highway driving pretty aggressively and I averaged 31 miles a gallon. I'm currently on a country road at 45 miles an hour on cruise control flat grounds and I'm getting 53 miles a gallon.

There's no incentive for me to buy electric, and even if someone gave me a car for free I really wouldn't have the ability to use it daily This is a subreddit devoted to Team Losi Racing R/C vehicles.

I thought the comments were interesting on this one.^","UsedCars",228,228,0,0.82,0,0,0,1170,"https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedCars/comments/18v41da/why_are_evs_selling_like_crap/","BigTopGT","2024-01-01",1704146782,1,1,0,0,"People want EVs so badly that they're buying them in spite of a failure from Legacy manufacturers to sort out the overall user experience and charging system network.

So, unless it's a Tesla, you're met with immediate disappointment and extreme frustration, which ruins it for everyone because the UI/IX is terrible. 

Listen, I'm not saying that Tesla's actual cars are the greatest thing since sliced bread, but you have to admit their infrastructure for charging the cars, from both a vehicle integration standpoint and actual location-level availability, is Head-and-Shoulders above anyone else.

I currently own a Model 3 and have tried to rent competing vehicles (Polestar, Bolt, etc...) just to see what else is out there, but every single time I get into a non-Tesla, it's nothing short of frustration, aggravation, and, when you combine that with the general lack of support from the rental agencies, it's just not great.

Tesla does the best job of integrating your charging needs into the car (including actually finding them), whereas other companies, like GM for example, are so invested in trying to sell you an additional service, they don't give you a pre-installed nav system that will help you get to functioning charging units.

It's just bad. 

I spent literal 2 hours driving between 5 charging locations in a Volt I rented, trying to recharge. It was so bad I almost ran out of charge and Hertz told me they'd charge me if I did...

Because non-Tesla dealers don't use a closed charging system, you often find yourself at charging stations that are either broken, unsafe, or slow to charge your car in a way that's wildly impractical for day-to-day use.

Tesla shows you how to get to the unit, you know the consistent expectations for the service and speed of the individual charging units before you even get there, the billing system is integrated right into the car, and you don't have to think about anything other than showing up, charging, and being on your way.

TL/DR: If they (not-Tesla) wants to sell more EV units, they need to make charging them easy.","279"

Further, they have soooo many many problems.

Charging times and stations being a priority. 

Repairs, running on software& it goes on and on and on.

What vehicles are required to be and do for the average consumer EVs cant do. 

Toyota is the most advanced and practical car maker in the world who pioneered EVs and when they did the math over a decade ago, they abandoned the idea.

No one but the manufacturer can work on them and it costs a fortune and something will definitely go wrong eventually. The range is trash. The batteries degrade over time so the range will slowly go down from the second you buy it. The charging infrastructure isnt there yet. The charge time is inconvenient to name a few. You will never replace the good old reliable gas burner that your uncle can fix in his driveway. And while they have a range, that can be solved with a 5 minute gas stop. And after hundreds of thousands of miles they maintain the same gas mileage and range instead of degrading the second you buy it. There isnt really a ticking time clock on the life of the car. It will go as long as the owner is willing to maintain it. I will start believing in EVs when I start seeing some hit 500k- 1m miles like a tundra can without costing you 200k in repairs. They have a lot of work to do before the people will be willing to commit to the idea.

It had been sitting at the dealership for awhile. It was a neat car, pretty good for local errands and such. The a/c was nice and cold. Heat was a bit lacking and would drain the battery faster than normal, but the heated seats and steering wheel helped. The car was subject to a battery recall which was resolved earlier this year. So, its a three year old car with a nearly new battery   

About a week before his passing, he took out a loan to purchase the car outright after the expiration of the lease. Seeing the paperwork for that has soured me on the idea of ever leasing a car because he was going to be paying almost as much or even more than the car cost at the time of the lease. 

Our parents kind of wanted to buy the car since it seemed like a good grocery getter, but they decided the payment was more than they needed to take on. So, the CU took it back in early November, and its been sitting for sale in their parking lot ever since. 

Everyone is being pressured to rush lemming-like off the EV cliff. EVs are touted as the solution to just about every transportation-related problem. They do have their place in the automotive universe, but theyre not a good choice for most people. Also, the battery technology just isnt there for them to be a good long-term purchase. More people can hang on to ICE vehicles because they tend to last longer than they used to. When an EV battery starts to crap out before the vehicle is even paid for, thats a big problem.","314"

Home charging is a big problem for a lot of buyers. Not only is public charging horribly inconvenient for a lot of people, its also usually expensive.

A lot of potential buyers have battery health anxiety leading them to only consider new. This is largely caused by the couple of EVs,like the Leaf, that have crazy battery degradation.","331"

It's a fact EVs will die in the second decade regardless of usage. An ICE has the potential to go further than that. Just type in 2004 corolla (or any other mass produced ICE) and with a little searching you will find a mighty clean one with no crazy miles on it. An EV will never make it there on their original battery worth a damn.

Buyer beware on out of warranty EVs too. There are companies who pull the battery, bypass dead cells causing the issue or replace a dead portion with a used one that still works and put them back together again. You're still driving with a bunch of other old cells just waiting to peace out.

That's the catch-22, the next innovation cycle for batteries is about 3 years away so why would anyone spend 50k+ for tech that will soon be obsolete/less efficient.  Used EVs have older tech, older batteries that are less efficient and closer to a required replacement cycle.  Replacing the batteries in a used EV costs more than the original EV's MSRP, and it's likely that the original owner didn't maintain the batteries.

The reason people exchange smartphones so much isn't just because of the battery, it's a myriad of other stuff. The system gets bloated with updates and slow down to the point of becoming unusable, new phones get better technology and functions that actually contributes to how they work (like 5g and better cameras), and, most importantly which is probably the thing that makes people exchange phones the most, you CAN'T exchange batteries when yours go puff. 

Meanwhile, all a car has to do is go from here to there, and just making a better battery won't really change that.

Sure, almost nobody uses old phones anymore, but you still see people going around with cars from the 80s to 2000s. So I don't see how it's the same thing.","2_2_1"

I just fundamentally don't understand it. My rule of thumb is approximately For every two grand that you pay for a car in US dollars it should last you one year. If you spend $1,000 on a car, it's probably going to last about 6 months. 

That's the cost effective metric of car ownership in my book If you're buying a car for cost effectiveness. If you're buying a car for wanting to throw away money then you use a different metric.

If You spend 26 Grand on a new Toyota you should drive it for at least 13 years. If you get 14 out of it you're ahead and if you get 12 you lost money on your car. Everyone's formula will be slightly different depending on where they live and a bunch of other factors like the number of miles they put on. 

But for me it's about 2k Maybe $2,500 now with inflation. 

If you buy a $45,000 car, there is virtually 0.0% Chance that you will be able to drive that car long enough that it will actually be cost effective compared to an alternative. Such as a Toyota Corolla. 

They are depreciating assets, But they're also kind of investments in your future of not having to buy another car. And if you make the wrong decision, it's going to end up costing you. But more often than not, I see most people not doing the math on their car purchase.","4_6"

You have to figure out the marginal cost of owning a car per year. In order to make good budgeting decisions for owning a car. Obviously if you're willing to spend 100K on a car, you're not buying it because it's supposed to be affordable and a good business decision.

It's so bad that Tesla has a ""guaranteed resale"" program to try and limit it to a 50% drop in value after 3 years. 

iSeeCars analyzed over 1.8 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in February 2023 and 2024. By comparing the average prices of cars by segment, brand and model, the analysis shows a general softening of used car prices overall, but a dramatic drop in used electric vehicle prices.

Stuff like most cars seeing a 5-8% drop year over year, but Tesla seeing a near 30% price drop. So nobody out here recouping even close to their purchase price when they sell one used.

Of course the resale value dropped, you can get one brand new for less.

New cars are expensive, and a new car with a new battery technology will probably be even more expensive for a while at least.  Then there are the first couple of model years while the manufacturers work out the bugs.  Even when they've fully replaced lithium ion batteries on new cars, it isn't like the older cars are going to just stop working.  There are 20 year old Priuses still on the road today, and you can get lithium battery retrofit kits to replace some of the older battery technologies to keep those older cars going.  I would expect the same thing to happen, so we'll start to see solid battery tech retrofit kits for today's EVs, making them reliable used cars for many years to come.

The only way I would see them becoming ""worthless"" over the next few years is if the charging infrastructure requires a drastic change to support the new vehicles to the point that it isn't compatible with the older cars.  Even then we'll see adapters, people will still home-charge, and again we'll see retrofit kits to upgrade the onboard chargers and/or batteries to be compatible as that will be cheap compared to a new car.","53"

EV batteries have a shelf life of at least 7 years. Meaning you'll replace the battery 2 more times in the same time span that my camry will stop running.

Batteries can cost up anywhere between $7k to $20k. This defeats the purpose of not paying for petrol.

The average person pays $30-40 at the pump for a standard sedan. They fill about once every 2 weeks. In a span of 7 years, they'll visit the pump 182 times.

It doesn't seem like you're the type to base your electric car opinions on 1980s vibes, but I think you could stand to be more optimistic.Total battery recycling has always been possible, simply expensive. It's been cheaper to just make new batteries than to try to harvest old materials. But there's quite a few lithium recyclers and repurposing companies cropping up worldwide. 



Consider that many millions of pre-used automobile battery packs could end up installed in homes as sinks for excess solar or wind production. As more cars hit the market, more batteries are likely to be repurposed or recycled. Businesses might consider purchasing larger arrays as power backups. As more used batteries are distributed and installed into the power grid, they may yield a stabilizing effect, should proper infrastructure be in place to utilize the storage resources. 


By worthless, though, I assume you mean, ""little resale value of the automobile by owner"" and that may actually be true.
